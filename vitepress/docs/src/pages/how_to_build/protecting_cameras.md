# Protecting a Camera Ribbon Cable  {.text-[var(--font-accent)]}

The ribbon cables that these cameras use are notoriously prone to damage rendering them useless.  

By wrapping them in tape such as electrical tape and following best practices covered in the guide, you can significantly reduce the risk of killing a camera.

## Wraping the Camera Ribbon
First get a roll of electrical tape to wrap the camera ribbon.
It does not strictly need to be electrical tape, but that is what I have found to work good, (and look good too).

<ImageCard :options="image_settings.camera_protect1" />

Place the camera on the tape so that the entire bottom area including the sensor are covered and that one side of the camera ribbon has slightly more tape (helps make it look good).

<ImageCard :options="image_settings.camera_protect2" />

Cut the tape from the roll, here I used flat cutters.
Be careful to not cut the camera connector in the process.

<ImageCard :options="image_settings.camera_protect3" />
<ImageCard :options="image_settings.camera_protect4" />

With the tape cut from the roll, lay it down and get out a X-ACTO knife.
